<h1>Mommy and Me Coding Website</h1>
<p>This project was a fun challenge between me and my 7-year-old son. We each created a webpage for one another, and it was such a great way to learn and spend time together. Please note that part of this project specifically the “Silvynn’s Project” tab—was created by my son. He’s only 7, and I’m really proud of what he built. This project was a mix of creativity, learning, and bonding, and we had a lot of fun doing it.</p>
